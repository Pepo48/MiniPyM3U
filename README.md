# MiniPyM3U

This project is a Python package for parsing M3U files and shrinking them based on a database of sports channels.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use this package, run the `app.py` script in the `ui` directory:

```sh
python ui/app.py
```

This will open a GUI where you can select an M3U file to process. The processed file will be saved as `output.m3u` in the project root directory.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the `test.m3u` file in the `tests` directory.
